Lab project for SC2006 SWE

## Project Description
With the Wanderful web application, drivers can set up carpooling trips that passengers can book, while passengers can search for carpooling opportunities. By checking out the rides available from drivers in their chosen starting area, users can travel around Singapore more efficiently.
The primary objective is to provide a one-stop platform that enables all commuters in Singapore to conveniently book carpools and taxi rides. By accessing the website, users can view available carpool rides and easily book their preferred options. To facilitate this process, the website integrates with the Taxi API and Car Park API, enabling users to quickly locate taxi alternatives and drivers to identify nearby parking facilities.
